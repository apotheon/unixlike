You've stumbled into a celebration of the Unix philosophy.  You may ask "What is the Unix philosophy?"

According to Doug McIlroy:

> Do One Thing And Do It Well

According to Mike Gancarz:

> 1. Small is beautiful.</li>
> 1. Make each program do one thing well.</li>
> 1. Build a prototype as soon as possible.</li>
> 1. Choose portability over efficiency.</li>
> 1. Store data in flat text files.</li>
> 1. Use software leverage to your advantage.</li>
> 1. Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.</li>
> 1. Avoid captive user interfaces.</li>
> 1. Make every program a filter.</li>
