Once upon a time, someone else registered the unixlike.us domain.  Eventually, that person let it lapse.

The prior domain maintainer's content can be found on the Wayback Machine, archived from 2013:

If you're looking for kindred spirits, try the IRC channel:

* libera/#anomalous
* libera/##copyfree

If you don't already have a local IRC client, try a web client:

* [#anomalous webchat](https://web.libera.chat/#anomalous)
* [##copyfree webchat](https://web.libera.chat/##copyfree)
