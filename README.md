# Unix Like Us

## NAME

Unix - It's user friendly.  It's just picky about its friends.

## SYNOPSIS

    #!/bin/sh

    echo 'Where there's a shell, there's a way.'

## DESCRIPTION

* Us: We are people who like the Unix philosophy.  We have a website.

* Unix-Like: An operating system is Unix-like if it Unixy -- that is, it
  largely adheres to the Unix philosophy, largely follows the lead of the POSIX
  standard, and largely acts like a UNIX system.  Alternatively, Unix-like is
  the appreciation of, and affection for, Unixy environments.

* Unix: Unix is that class of operating systems that are Unixy/Unix-like and
  descended from original UNIX.  This includes those OSes that both conform to
  the SUS (Single UNIX Specification) and the POSIX standard, and paid a bunch
  of money for certification so they could use the UNIX trademwark.  It also
  includes those OSes that did none of these things to be called UNIX, and thus
  fall under other subsets of Unix systems.  Not all UNIX systems are Unix
  systems (in that they are eligible by law to employ the UNIX trademark but
  are not very Unix-like, e.g. MacOS and even worse examples un-Unixy systems),
  and not all Unix systems are UNIX systems.

* BSD Unix: Unix whose source code is specifically descended from the Berkeley
  Software Distribution branch of the original UNIX family are BSD Unix systems
  (sometimes shortened to BSD or BSDs, though that is imprecise to the point of
  inaccuracy).  The most famous of these are (in likely order from most
  well-known to least well-known) FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, and
  TrueOS.  Others also exist, primarly as more purpose-specific spin-offs of
  those.  TrueOS itself is to some extent an ongoing project of maintaining a
  more purpose-specific spin-off of FreeBSD, though the name is applicable to a
  couple of subprojects with different purposes.
